# Building an Event Driven Architecture Using AWS S3, Lambda, and SNS Services

## Introduction
In a world where data flows seamlessly and decisions are made in real-time, event-driven architectures have emerged as a game-changer. I had the exciting opportunity to delve into this realm and
create an event-driven architecture utilizing AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and SNS. This project not only expanded my technical prowess but also deepened my understanding of how cloud services
can orchestrate dynamic processes.





Event Driven Architecture Using AWS S3, Lambda, And SNS Services
Welcome to my project on building an event-driven architecture using AWS services! In this project, we've set up a seamless system that triggers actions in response to file uploads to an Amazon S3 bucket. Here's a quick overview of what we've achieved:

Overview
S3 Event Trigger: Configured an S3 event that detects when files are uploaded to a specific bucket.
Lambda Function: Developed a Lambda function that is automatically invoked by the S3 event.
Distinguishing Files and Folders: Demonstrated how to distinguish between file and folder uploads using the object key in the S3 event.
SNS Notification: Integrated the Lambda function with Amazon SNS to send real-time notifications about the uploads.
