# Building an Event Driven Architecture Using AWS S3, Lambda, and SNS Services

## Introduction
In a world where data flows seamlessly and decisions are made in real-time, event-driven architectures have emerged as a game-changer. I had the exciting opportunity to delve into this realm and
create an event-driven architecture utilizing AWS services such as S3, Lambda, and SNS. This project not only expanded my technical prowess but also deepened my understanding of how cloud services
can orchestrate dynamic processes.

## Objective:
The goal of the project was to establish a robust event-driven architecture that responds intelligently to data changes in an AWS S3 bucket. Leveraging AWS Lambda functions and SNS notifications, we aimed to enable timely processing and distribution of relevant data updates to downstream systems.

##Key Components
1. AWS S3 Bucket: Acting as the event source, the S3 bucket stores data files that trigger the event-driven workflow whenever a new file is added.
2. AWS Lambda Functions: We designed Lambda functions to execute specific actions based on incoming events. These functions were tailored to process, transform, and analyze data as per the business logic.
3. Distinguishing Files and Folders: Demonstrated how to distinguish between file and folder uploads using the object key in the S3 event.
4. AWS SNS (Simple Notification Service): SNS acted as the glue, allowing seamless communication between Lambda functions and downstream systems. When an event occurred, Lambda functions would publish notifications to SNS topics.

##Workflow
1. Event Trigger: As a new data file landed in the S3 bucket, an event was triggered, kickstarting the architecture.
2. Lambda Functions in Action: The Lambda functions, designed for specific tasks, were invoked to process the incoming data. For example, data validation, transformation, and enrichment were some of the tasks accomplished through these functions.
3. SNS Notifications: Once the data was processed, Lambda functions published notifications to relevant SNS topics. This initiated the distribution of processed data to subscribing systems, enabling real-time updates.


##Key Takeaways

- Scalability and Responsiveness: The architecture showcased its prowess in handling large datasets and rapidly responding to changes. This is crucial for applications demanding real-time insights.
- Decoupled Systems: The event-driven design led to loosely coupled components, enhancing system flexibility and maintainability.
- Cost Efficiency: AWS Lambda's serverless architecture meant that resources were allocated only when needed, optimizing costs.
- Real-world Applications: The skills and insights gained from this project are directly transferable to real-world scenarios where timely data processing is essential.
  
##Conclusion
Building an event-driven architecture using AWS S3, Lambda, and SNS was a rewarding experience that exemplified the power of cloud-native solutions. As I continue to refine my knowledge in cloud technologies, this project stands as a testament to the transformative potential of event-driven architectures in enabling data-driven decision-making in today's fast-paced world.
